# Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) for Clustering
  
## Overview
This project implements a clustering algorithm based on symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF). The algorithm is applied to several datasets and is compared with the K-means clustering method. The main goal is to form clusters based on the provided data points.

## Features
- Implementation in both C and Python.
- Python-C interface for efficient computation.
- Analysis tool to compare SymNMF with Kmeans clustering.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- GCC Compiler
- Python's numpy module

## How to Run
### Compilation:
To compile the C module:
```
$make
```
To build the Python extension:
```
$python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
### Execution:
For the Python program:
```
$python3 symnmf.py <k> <goal> <input_file.txt>
```
For the C program:
```
$./symnmf <goal> <input_file.txt>
```
For analysis comparing SymNMF with Kmeans:
```
$python3 analysis.py <k> <input_file.txt>
```
